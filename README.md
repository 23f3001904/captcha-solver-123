# Captcha Solver Interface This project provides a simple, responsive web interface for solving image-based captchas. It's built with HTML and styled using Tailwind CSS, allowing users to input their solution and check its correctness. ## Features *   **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes, from mobile to desktop. *   **Dynamic Image Loading**: Loads captcha images either from a URL parameter (`?url=...`) or defaults to a local `sample.png` file. *   **User Input**: Provides an input field for users to type their captcha solution. *   **Solution Verification**: Checks the user's input against a predefined correct solution (for demonstration purposes) and provides immediate feedback. *   **Tailwind CSS**: Modern and utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling. ## How to Use 1.  **Clone the Repository (or save `index.html`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`):** If you have these files locally, you can directly open `index.html` in your web browser. 2.  **Open `index.html`:** Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser. 3.  **Load a Captcha Image:** *   **Default:** The application will automatically display the `sample.png` image located in the same directory. *   **Custom URL:** To load a different captcha image, append a `url` query parameter to the `index.html` URL. Example: `index.html?url=https://example.com/path/to/your/image.png` 4.  **Solve the Captcha:** *   Look at the displayed image. *   Type the characters you see in the input field. *   Click the "Submit Captcha" button or press `Enter`. 5.  **View Results:** The application will tell you if your solution is "Correct!" or "Incorrect." ## Technologies Used *   **HTML5**: Structure of the web page. *   **Tailwind CSS**: For all styling and responsive design. *   **JavaScript**: For dynamic image loading, user interaction, and captcha verification logic. ## License This project is licensed under the MIT License.
